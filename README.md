# Photoshoot Manager

This project is a culmination of existing tools I use to manage photoshoots, costs, model information, model releases, etc.  The current tools used consist of the following

 - **Google Sheets:** Used for keeping track of Model info, what they shoot, their contact info, rates, as well as past photoshoot information including locations, costs, outfits, hair and makeup artists, etc.  This serves as a record to record every single photoshoot done.
 - **Easy Release Pro:**  This application (paid in android/apple stores) serves as a model release tool.  Model/Photoshoot information is filled out in a form, and then a model signs the release, which is then emailed back to them and the photographer.
