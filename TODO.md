# Scope of work 

Below are things I don't know how to accomplish that I'm looking to have implemented:

- The menu drawer on the left "springs" back when opened(the text items within), it's a little annoying, is there a way to fix this?  The source of this drawer was https://github.com/BenjaminMahmic/collapsible_drawer.git, I've only sligtly modified it so far.
- When an item in the menu is clicked, it should open a view/page/section on in the right pane... I.e click models, and the right section is replaced with the models list, click "releases" and you're taken to the model rlease section, etc.
- Make the right side of the screen responsive (not so big of a deal on mobile, but if i run this in a browser/windows, the content in the right pane should scale approrpriately.  If you have resources you can link to to cover this that's satisfactory as well.
- Looking for reccomendations on a few things:
  - For database activity (creating schema, accessing database, etc) would that best be left in the main.dart file, a seperate .dart file (like the drawer), and does each page need code that re-opens the database? Looking at SQLIite for now.
  - How difficult is it to animate the "tap" of the menu items, with like a whole-box shade (to indcate you tapped the row/list item)? I imagine its not too difficult and can google it if needed. 

# Outside scope of work

- any theming..this will be done by a UI/UX designer I know at a later date if the project becomes viable
- code optimization (unless it's necessary to fix the items above).  I'm trying to first sus out if this is a doable project with my experience (as hiring a full time developer could be costly, and I'm trying to lear).  This can always be done later
- anything else...basically just fix the menu drawer rubber banding thing and get it to open pages in the right side of the screen.


Thank you for taking a look at this!
